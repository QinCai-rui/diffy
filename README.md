# Diffy Squares Project

This project includes two scripts for solving the Diffy Squares problem. There were more than two scripts but due to the fact that I have worked on multiple machines to complete this project, I cannot find the other files (I forgot to commit changes!!). I will try and search through all the devices I have worked on and (hopefully!) I can put them back here!

This project was inspired by the NZMO, I think New Zealand Mathematical Olympiad? For backgroud info, fell free to read the last part of this readme (that was generated my chatgpt!)

## Files

### 1. `diffy.py`

A script to find the highest possible score within a given range of numbers using the Diffy Squares method.

#### Functions
- `diffy_squares(a, b, c, d)`: Calculates the number of iterations required for four numbers to become zero.
- `find_max_score(lower_range_limit, upper_range_limit)`: Finds the maximum score within the specified range and prints the numbers achieving that score.

#### Usage
```bash
python diffy.py
```
Follow the prompts to enter the minimum and maximum number range.

### 2. `diffy_square_tester.py`

A script that allows users to input four numbers and see how many rounds they last in the Diffy Squares process.

#### Functions
- `diffy_squares(a, b, c, d)`: Calculates and prints the number of iterations for four numbers to become zero.
- `numbers_response()`: Gets user input for four numbers and prints the number of rounds they last.

#### Usage
```bash
python diffy_square_tester.py
```
Enter the four numbers when prompted.

## Dependencies (really not dependencies!)
- Python 3.x

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Save the scripts in the same directory.
3. Run the scripts as described in the usage sections above.

## Example output (I made it run in the backgroud, and one day later...)

## What Are Diffy Squares? (Description generated by GPT-4 with modifications)

Ahoy, adventurers! üåä Ever stumbled upon a maths puzzle that's both simple and mind-blowingly fun? Meet Diffy Squares! This gem of a challenge starts with four numbers and turns them into zeroes through a magical sequence of differences. It's like alchemy, but for numbers!

### How Does It Work?

1. **Pick Four Numbers**: Any four will do ‚Äì whole numbers, decimals, negatives, you name it.
2. **Calculate Differences**: Swap each number with the absolute difference of it and the next one (yep, it loops around).
3. **Repeat**: Keep going until all four numbers turn into zero. Trust us, it‚Äôs cooler than it sounds.

### Why Should You Care?

Diffy Squares isn‚Äôt just a math exercise; it‚Äôs a journey into the hidden patterns of numbers. It's the perfect blend of a mental workout and a delightful game. Plus, it‚Äôs a killer party trick for your fellow math enthusiasts!

### Give It A Go!

Grab some scratch paper or fire up your favourite code editor, and dive into the world of Diffy Squares. You‚Äôll be hooked before you know it!

Let the maths magic begin! ‚ú®üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
